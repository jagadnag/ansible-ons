# APIs Exercise 6

1. Use the "debug cli" while executing show commands on the Palo Alto firewall to start to get a feel for what the XML API looks like.

```
debug cli on
show interface management
```

2. Convert the show command executed in the previous task to an API call using the Ansible "uri" or "get_url" modules.

3. Print the IP address to stdout.
