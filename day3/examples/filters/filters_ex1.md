# Filters

Filters basically modify variables. There are a *lot* of filters available; the documentation as always is a great place to start, you can find that [here](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_filters.html).

In the filters example we cover a few basic, but very useful filters including:

- `min`: get the minimum value from a list of values
- `max`: get the maximum value from a list of values
- `flatten`: flatten nested lists into a single level list
- `unique`: return only unique items in a list
- `difference(something)`: find the difference between a given item and another item
- `random_mac`: produce a random mac address, because why not!

Check out the example Playbook to see these in action!
