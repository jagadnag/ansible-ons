# APIs Example 2

Moving away from the traditional network devices to RESTful APIs poses some different challenges. In general, there are two main obstacles to starting work with a new API: 1) authentication and 2) learning the structure.

For this example, skip the authentication worries, and get familiar with a modern RESTful API using Star Wars! Take a look at "SWAPI" [here](https://swapi.co). This website provides an open, well [documented](https://swapi.co/documentation) API for getting familiar with APIs and of course gaining valuable knowledge about Star Wars.

Note that when using the `uri` module you will often (as in this example) run tasks against the localhost (or delegate to the localhost) -- this is similar to the "network" mode of operation with Ansible.
