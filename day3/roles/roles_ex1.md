# Roles Exercise 1

1. Convert the monolithic Playbook specified [here](https://github.com/ktbyers/ansible_course/blob/master/class6/exercises/monolithic.yml) into a roles structure with three separate roles (cisco_ios, arista, cisco_nxos). All the variables should be moved to ./vars/main.yaml; all the tasks should be moved to ./tasks/main.yaml (for each of the respective roles).
