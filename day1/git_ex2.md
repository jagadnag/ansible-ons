# Git Exercise 2

1. Create a branch in your lab environment
2. Switch to this branch
3. Add a file and commit this new file (in the new branch)
4. Push the new branch up to GitHub
5. Merge the new branch into the master branch
6. [Optional] Fork this repository; clone this repository to the
   lab environment (your fork); commit a change to your fork; submit
   a pull request on this via GitHub.
7. [Optional] Do a practice rebase. Rebase your fork (created
   in step 6) based on any commits that I have made to this
   repository.
