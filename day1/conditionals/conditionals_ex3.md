# Conditionals Exercise 3

1. Write a Playbook that executes the "eos_facts" module against the arista group. Register the output of this task to a new variable.

2. Write a Task in your Play that prints positive confirmation that the version of the Arista devices begins with (the major version is) "4".

3. Write another Task that prints a message if the "lineprotocol" of the "Management1" interface is "down".

4. Rather than checking for just the management interface, iterate through all of the interfaces and print the name of the interface and the "lineprotocol" state.
