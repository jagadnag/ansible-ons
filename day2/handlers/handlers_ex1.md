# Handlers Exercise 1

1. Write a Playbook with a Play that runs against only the localhost. In this Playbook create a task that prints "hello, world" to stdout.

2. Create a handler called "say hi back", and set the previously created debug task up to "notify" this handler. Does the handler fire? Figure out how to get the handler to fire -- hint: why is the task GREEN?
