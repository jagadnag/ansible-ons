# Handlers Exercise 2

1. Write a Playbook with a Play that runs against the cisco group. In this Playbook, using whatever means you like, configure a loopback interface with a description on each of the cisco devices.

2. Create a handler to save the config, and a handler to print a message notifying you that a change has occured. Ensure that the Playbook is idempotent.
