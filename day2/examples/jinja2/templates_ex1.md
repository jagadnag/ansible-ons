# Jinja2 Templates

The example for this section is pretty complete so it should serve as a good cheat-sheet! The concept of Jinja templating is pretty straightforward -- create a template, and for every host that your Play is executing against, fill in the appropriate values on the template and output the result to a text file (typically named after the host that the task was operating against).

This example template contains "includes" mechanisms, looping, and conditional checks.
