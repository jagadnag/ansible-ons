# More Configuration Exercise 3

1. Create three loopback interfaces with random /32 IP addresses. Use a random number for the loopback ID (i.e. looback.123).

2. Create three zones (use your name/initials in the interfaces to not overlap with other students) in layer3 mode. Assign one of the previously created loopbacks to each zone. Ensure that your Playbook is idempotent!
